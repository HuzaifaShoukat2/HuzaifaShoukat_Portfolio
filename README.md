I created a full multi-page, responsive, neon-accented portfolio design and included detailed Achievements & Certifications blocks with descriptions (Musixmatch award + Sellfy Hall of Fame + certifications list). The UI uses **white text with neon accents** (no dull grey on black) and has an eye-catching, futuristic look.


If you want, I will now:
- Fill project cards with the real project titles, repo links and live links if you paste them here. I'll add more cards and make them private (show only on request) if needed.
- Generate a ready-to-upload ZIP file of the project (I can't supply an external link here, but I can produce the exact files for you to copy) â€” tell me if you'd like that.


I went ahead and updated your canvas project with all files. Copy the files into your project folder and deploy. Want me to add your real project details and certificate links into the pages now? (If yes, paste them and I will add them.)
